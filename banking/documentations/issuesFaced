1)Models field not showing-up in the admin portal
    soln:
    class Branch(models.Model):
        id = models.AutoField(primary_key=True)
        branch_name = models.CharField(default='Chennai', max_length=30, null=False)
        address = models.CharField(max_length=30, null=False,default=None)
        def __str__(self):
            return f'{self.id} - {self.branch_name} -  {str(self.address)}

3) deleting migration files:
    deleting migration file may cause issues. if we-dontcare-about-the-data/db-is-empty then drop-db/ create new is the solution.
    drop-db: simply delete the db.sqlite3 file
    create: automatically create in sqlite3

4) Add-on: have one migration from the bunch of migrations files
    mice-vignesh@micevignesh-ThinkPad-T430:~/Downloads/myprojects/banking/personalbanking$ python3 ../manage.py squashmigrations personalbanking 0002
    Will squash the following migrations:
     - 0001_initial
     - 0002_auto_20200502_1031

    Optimizing...
      Optimized from 4 operations to 3 operations.
    Created new squashed migration /home/mice-vignesh/Downloads/myprojects/banking/personalbanking/migrations/0001_squashed_0002_auto_20200502_1031.py
      You should commit this migration but leave the old ones in place;
      the new migration will be used for new installs. Once you are sure
      all instances of the codebase have applied the migrations you squashed,
      you can delete them.
